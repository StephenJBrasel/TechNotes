	To Store a Password
		Generate a long random salt using a CSPRNG (Cryptographically Secure Pseudo-Random Number Generator).
		Prepend the salt to the password and hash it with a standard password hashing function like Argon2, bcrypt, scrypt, or PBKDF2.
		Save both the salt and the hash in the user's database record.
	To Validate a Password
		Retrieve the user's salt and hash from the database.
		Prepend the salt to the given password and hash it using the same hash function.
		Compare the hash of the given password with the hash from the database. 
			If they match, the password is correct. Otherwise, the password is incorrect.
